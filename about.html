		<p>
			I am a recent graduate of Virginia Tech's Pamplin School of Business. I began my academic career majoring in Biology and Human Nutrition Science with the goal of pursuing a medical career. However, while working in various dental offices, I quickly realized that I enjoy using technology to solve organizational needs more than participating in clinical work. Building upon this realization, I discovered my passion for technology and programming, which I hope to utilize in solving future customers' and clients' business needs.

		<p>
			Following my junior year transition from Science to Business, I completed an internship at Booz Allen Hamilton and worked to resolve compliance issues and complications associated with the EU passing The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) legislation. During my senior year at Virginia Tech, I also participated in pro-bono consulting with a local marketing consulting agency, Eddy Alexander. With the support of my team, I successfully standardized procedures, built organizational infrastructure to facilitate the time management of senior marketers, and streamlined the composition of all processed documents.
			<br>
			<br>
			I spent much of my collegiate experience building technical skills that I found to be interesting, and more importantly, challenging. After transitioning to Business, I quickly began developing a foundation in Excel, Excel VBA, and Python through my elective courses. These experiences awarded me a fundamental understanding of programming and sparked a drive to learn more languages in the future.
