		<p>
			I am a recent graduate of Virginia Tech's Pamplin School of Business. I began my academic career majoring in Biology and Human Nutrition Science with the goal of pursuing a medical career. However, while working in various dental offices, I was amused by the wide array of technological challenges that they faced. I became interested in solving these technological challenges to advance customer experience and employee behavior more than the clinical work. Building upon this realization, I uncovered my passion for technology and for building products and processes to improve businesses from a customer and employee standpoint.

		<p>
			Following my junior year transition from Science to Business, I completed an internship at Booz Allen Hamilton and worked alongside my clients to solve the ambiguous and everchanging challenges with the newly passed EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) legislation. During my senior year at Virginia Tech, I consulted for Eddy Alexander, a local marketing consulting agency. With the support of my team, I successfully standardized procedures, built organizational infrastructure to facilitate the time management of senior management, and streamlined the composition of all processed documents.
			<br>
			<br>
			I spent much of my collegiate experience building technical skills that I found to be interesting, and more importantly, challenging. After my transition to Business, I quickly began developing a foundation in Excel, Excel VBA, and Python through my elective courses. These experiences awarded me a fundamental understanding of object-oriented programming and sparked a drive to make impact on organizations and individuals using technology.
			<br>
			<br>
			Since February 2020, when COIVD-19 ran across the world, I have dedicated myself to exploring my passion for coding. Over the past months, I have built a foundational understanding of front-end development (HTML, CSS, and SCSS) while also familiarizing myself with back-end development (Java).

		<p>
			Outside of academic and professional development, I enjoy spending meaningful time with my two brothers, the eldest being an Intellectual Property Attorney at Bookoff McAndrews and the middle brother being a Product Manager at Amazon, as well as my parents, two Iranian immigrants who paved the way for their three sons. Growing up in Northern Virginia and playing football through high school, I am a passionate Washington Redskins fan and a hold a love for all D.C. sports teams, no matter how disappointing and frustrating their seasons may be. I spend much of my free time working out and focusing on fitness, watching sporting events with family and friends, reading about self-made entrepreneurs, and learning personal growth habits to implement in my day-to-day life. I have also begun producing and creating music as a side hobby, which I personally find to be stress-relieving and an interesting conversational topic amongst most of my colleagues.

			As I look ahead, I hope to gain experience driving change within organizations by leveraging technology and focusing my efforts around the customer experience. In the near future, I will continue honing my craft and work towards becoming a better developer as well as continuing to search for ways to use technology as an enabler for businesses.
