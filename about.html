					I am a recent graduate of Virginia Tech's Pamplin School of Business. I began my academic career majoring in Biology and Human Nutrition Science with hopes to pursue a medical career later on; however, while working in various dental offices I quickly realized that I enjoy using technology to solve organizational needs rather than participating in the clinical work that takes place in the back. With this realization, I found my new interests in technology and programming, in which I hope to utilize to solve future customers' and clients' business needs.

					Outside of classes and work, I enjoy spending meaningful time with my family and friends. Coming from Virginia and being a football fanatic, I'm a huge Washington Redskins fan and love D.C. sports in general. I spend a lot of my free time working out, playing sports, or watching sports with friends and family. I also have began making music, hip-hop music specifically, as another side hobby of mine. And recently, I've found it to be a lot of fun to work on my programming skills during my free time as well!

						In the upcoming years, I hope to gain experience as a consultant while using my technical skillset to identify and alleviate organizations' pain points. With my recent programming interests, I hope to master front-end development in the near future and get my feet wet as a professional programmer within a few years.
