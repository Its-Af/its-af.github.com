		<p>
			I am a recent graduate of Virginia Tech's Pamplin School of Business. I began my academic career majoring in Biology and Human Nutrition Science with hopes to pursue a medical career later on; however, while working in various dental offices I quickly realized that I enjoy using technology to solve organizational needs rather than participating in the clinical work that takes place in the back. With this realization, I found my new interests in technology and programming, which I hope to utilize to solve future customers' and clients' business needs.

		<p>
			Following my transition from Science to Business (sophomore year to junior year), I was fortunate to intern with Booz Allen Hamilton during the Summer of 2019 and work to solve compliance issues and complications that the firm encountered when GDPR (The General Data Protection Regulation) was passed in the EU. During my senior year at Virginia Tech, I also participated in pro-bono consulting with a local marketing consulting agency, Eddy Alexander where my team and I were able to standardize many procedures, alleviate responsibility from the top managers of the firm when it came to remembering what and when things had to be done, and streamline and eliminate any waste that was identified in the many processes documented.
			<br>
			<br>
			Along with my work experience, during my time in undergrad I sought after technical skills that I found to be interesting and fun. After transitioning to Business, I quickly picked up Excel, Excel VBA, and Python through my elective courses aside from my in-major required courses. This experience has gave me a foundational understanding of programming and sparked an interest to learn more languages in the future.
			<br>
			<br>
			Since February 2020, around the time when COVID-19 took the world by storm, I began focusing my efforts on learning more technical skills. In the small time that has passed, I have began to build the foundation to understanding front-end developemnt (HTML, CSS, SCSS) as well as a small portion of back-end development (Java).

		<p>
			Outside of classes and work, I enjoy spending meaningful time with my family and friends. Coming from Virginia and being a football fanatic, I'm a huge Washington Redskins fan and love D.C. sports in general. I spend a lot of my free time working out, playing sports, or watching sports with friends and family. I also have began making music, hip-hop music specifically, as another side hobby of mine. And recently, I've found it to be a lot of fun to work on my programming skills during my free time as well.

	<section class="section section-dark">
		<p>
			In the upcoming years, I hope to gain experience as a consultant while using my technical skillset to identify and alleviate organizations' pain points. With my recent programming interests, I hope to master front-end development in the near future and get my feet wet as a professional programmer within a few years.
